# Test App

- React and NodeJs
- User should be able to enter a number to the text field
- On page load, make a request to server and load the number in the textfield
    -- Pull the number from the file where it is stored
    -- Display 0, if no number is stored
- Replace the number if user enters a different number
    -- A submit button to replace the existing number
    -- Call NodeJs API to save the number to the existing file
- Use semantic/ Material UI for text and submit button (not too fancy)
- Use docker to build

## Note

- May use any library to make UI and backend
- No security needed
- Same file to store and retrieve number
